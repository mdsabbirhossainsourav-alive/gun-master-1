Gun Master
You have two guns: a close-range gun and a long-range gun.

The close-range gun can only shoot targets at distances less than or equal to D, while the long-range gun can only shoot targets at distances strictly greater than D.

You can only hold one gun at a time. Initially, you are holding the close-range gun.

You need to shoot at a series of N targets in order. The distance to the i-th target is Ai.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of times you need to switch between the two guns to shoot all N targets in the given order.
## Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines of input.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and D — the number of targets and the maximum effective range of the close-range gun.

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN,denoting the distances to the N targets in order.
## Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of gun switches required.
## Constraints
1≤T≤10 

1≤N≤100

1 ≤ Ai,D ≤ 100

The sum of N across all test cases won't exceed 2.10^5.

## Explanation:
Test case 1:D=2, so you can shoot at targets at distances ≤2 using the close-range gun. The targets are at distances [2,1,3,4],so the first two can be shot using the close-range gun and the last two using the long-range gun.
Only one switch is needed, between the second and third targets.

Test case 2: D=1, and the targets are at distances [2,3,4,1].The long-range gun must be used for the first three targets, and the close-range gun for the last target. Since you're initially holding the close-range gun, two switches are required - before shooting the first target, and after shooting the third target.

Test case 3: All targets can be shot using the close-range gun, so no switches are necessary.
